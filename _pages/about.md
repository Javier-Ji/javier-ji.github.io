I am a Ph.D. student from [Dr. Haipeng Yuâ€™s group](https://animal.ifas.ufl.edu/people/haipeng-yu/) in the department of Animal Sciences at [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/). 

My research interests focus on applying computer vision to acquire high-throughput animal phenomics data in precision livestock farming.
